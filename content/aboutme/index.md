# Background Information

I am **Soufiane Essahli**  (aka *HostileNinja72*), a passioned Cybersecurity student and member of the CTF team [0xNox](https://ctftime.org/team/271912) of The Euromed University of Fes. My journey into the world of cybersecurity and computer science is fueled by a never ending curiosity that has driven me since childhood to understand how things work.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for Astronomy, Philosophy and Sciences in general, which has helped me a lot into being an interdisciplinary thinker.
 
In this blog, I will share my experiences and insights from CTF competitions, along with articles and ideas that reflect my interests and insights, especially in the domain of cybersecurity.
