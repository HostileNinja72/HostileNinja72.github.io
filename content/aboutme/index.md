# Background Information

I am **Soufiane Essahli**, also known as HostileNinja72, a dedicated Cybersecurity student and member of the CTF team [0xNox](https://ctftime.org/team/271912) at The Euromed University of Fes. My journey into the world of cybersecurity and computer science is fueled by an insatiable curiosity that has driven me since childhood to understand how things work.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for Astronomy and Philosophy. In this blog, I will share my experiences and insights from CTF competitions, along with articles and ideas that reflect my interests and insights.
